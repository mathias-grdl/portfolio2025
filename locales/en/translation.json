    "description": "During my studies, I worked in various sectors such as Uber Eats, temp work, and as a salesperson in Angers and Tours, in northern France. Then, I moved to the south, 30 minutes from Spain, to pursue a one-year web development apprenticeship. At that time, I only knew HTML and CSS, but I quickly gained complete autonomy, creating pixel-perfect WordPress sites without themes or builders. I also learned to debug WordPress-related issues, manage hosting, and perform migrations. Thanks to this experience, I was able to start freelancing, which allowed me to begin learning ReactJS. With perseverance, I joined Radio Analyzer in Aalborg, Denmark, as a ReactJS front-end developer, where I actively contribute to developing innovative solutions for their SaaS products.",
